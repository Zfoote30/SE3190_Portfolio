        <h3>Project 1: Pantry</h3>
        <p>
          Purpose: -Created for Computer Science 309 Course -Meal Prep App that
          allows the user to plan out meals for the week, and then generates a
          shopping list based on the planned meals -Users can create a group and
          add other members to the group, allowing them to collaborate on what
          meals should be planned for the week -Includes a database for recipes,
          allowing users to share recipes with one another to create a community
          Pantry users
        </p>
        <p>
          My Role: - My team consisted of 4 students, 2 front-end and 2 back-end
          developers. I was one of the front-end developers. -Using Android
          Studio and Retrofit, I created the sign-up page, the home page, and
          most of the group pages, as well as created a group chat for each
          group using a socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills Learned: -I learned how to create basic apps and how the
          back-end and front-end communicate with each other. -I learned new
          software systems, such as Android Studio and Retrofit. - I learned how
          to use Java to create front-end code. - I gained experience using Git
          Lab and developed a strong understanding of source control platforms
          and how to share code effectively with a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Impact: -We never officially put Pantry on the Google Play Store, but
          the app works and correctly performs the functionality that we had
          hoped for it to perform. -Users have a calendar that they can use to
          plan out meals for the week, and the shopping cart is actually
          generated for them. -Moving forward, I feel very comfortable working
          with small teams and creating apps and other products for users.

        <h3>Project 2: MoonDeal</h3>
        <p>
          Purpose: -Created for Computer Engineering 166 Course -Chrome
          Extension that allows users to add items to a shopping cart through
          our extension. -When the objects in the cart go on sale, the user
          receives a notification email. -The email includes the previous and
          new price of the product, and a link straight back to the product so
          that the user can easily make a purchase if desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          - I was on a team of three students for this project. -My role was as
          a front-end developer. - Using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio, I
          created part of the home page, the download page, and the update page.
        </p>
        <p>
          -I learned HTML and CSS, which I had not worked with before this
          project. -I learned the basics of GitHub for source control for our
          project. -I gained experience working on some sort of product and
          gained practice trying to meet user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          -MoonDeal was on the Chrome extension store for a short period of time
          and currently, if we set the web domain back up, would work correctly
          and perform the base functionalities that we implemented. -Emails are
          actually sent to the user when the products go on sale, so the core
          functionality works perfectly. -Moving forward, I feel comfortable
          working with teams of peers and have a good understanding of
          strategies to help the group collaborate and operate effectively.
